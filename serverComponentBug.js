In Next.js 15, an uncommon error arises when using the `app` directory and server components with specific configurations.  If you have a server component that attempts to access a client-side module (like a module containing React components or hooks that depend on the browser's environment) directly, Next.js might fail silently or throw an unexpected error.  This is because server components run in a Node.js environment, lacking the browser's API and context.  Consider the scenario where you're importing a component with useSWR which uses browser's fetch api or any other client-side library inside a server component.

```javascript
// pages/api/route.js (server component)
import MyClientComponent from '@/components/MyClientComponent'; // This component uses client side fetch

export default function MyServerComponent() {
  return <MyClientComponent/>;
}
```
